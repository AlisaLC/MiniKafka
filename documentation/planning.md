### Planning Documentation


#### 1. Introduction


This document is a planning document for the project. It will contain the sections 
each team member will be working on, the tasks that need to be completed, and the
timeline for the project.


#### 2. Team Members

- Ali Salesi
- Soroush Sherafat
- Amirhossein Barati
- Arad Maleki


#### 3. Phase 1


Phase one of the project was the theoretical phase where we had to choose the architecture
of the project, the technologies we would be using, and the design of the project.

For this phase, we first had a meeting to discuss the roles of each team member, and broadly
discuss the architecture of the project. We then had a meeting with the TA to discuss the
architecture of the project and the technologies we would be using. 

For the roles of the team members in this phase, we had the following:

- All team members came to a conclusion on the architecture of the project, which is 
    documented in the phase 1 file.
- Ali Salesi was responsible for documenting the architecture of the project. This created 
    around 4 pages of pdf.
- Soroush Sherafat and Amirhossein Barati were responsible for the optional task of the
    phase, which was to calculate the overall cost of the project and decide whether it
    is feasible or not. This was documented in the phase 1 file.
- All team members held another meeting to approve the phase 1 file and submit it. This
    was done in person.



#### 4. Phase 2



This phase of the project is the implementation phase. Due to the mandatory scrum methodology,
we will be using the scrum methodology for this phase. The chosen sprints are as suggested, 4
sprints of 2 weeks each. 
Scrum meetings were held every week to discuss the progress of the project, and the tasks for
the next sprint.
The tasks for each sprint are as follows:


##### Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)


During this sprint, we will be setting up the project, and creating the basic structure of the
project. The tasks for this sprint are as follows:


- setting up the project
- creating the basic structure of the project
- adding a python client
- beginning the implementation of the broker
- booting up Trello


Due to the simplicity of the tasks, they were divided voluntarily. The tasks were divided as follows:


- Ali Salesi: setting up the project and creating the basic structure of the project and
    adding a python client
- Amirhossein Barati: booting up Trello
- Arad Maleki: beginning the basic files of documentation
- Soroush Sherafat: Learning Kubernetes and Docker


##### Sprint 2 (Week 3-4)


During this sprint, we will be implementing the broker, and the go client. Go was chosen as the
secondary language for the client by the team. We avoided using a wrapper for the second client
as we decided it was simpler to implement the client in go.
The tasks for this sprint are as follows:


- implementing the broker
- implementing the go client
- implementing the basic files of documentation
- updating Trello


The tasks were divided as follows:


- Ali Salesi: implementing the broker and the go client
- Amirhossein Barati: updating Trello and adding logging to the project
- Arad Maleki: adding documentation and learning CI/CD
- Soroush Sherafat: Learning Docker Compose and comparing it to Kubernetes


##### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)

During this sprint, we will implement the monitoring and fault tolerance of the project. We will
also begin implementing the CI/CD pipeline for the project. As for the Orchestrator, we will be
using Kubernetes for the project. The tasks for this sprint are as follows:


- implementing the monitoring using Prometheus
- visualizing the monitoring using Grafana
- implementing fault tolerance
- beginning the CI/CD pipeline


The tasks were divided as follows:


- Ali Salesi: implementing the monitoring using Prometheus and visualizing the monitoring using
    Grafana
- Amirhossein Barati: implementing fault
- Arad Maleki: beginning the CI/CD pipeline (Go pipeline), this was using Gihub Actions, which
    was decided by the team
- Soroush Sherafat: Learning Helm and beginning the implementation of the Orchestrator


##### Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)


During this sprint, we will be finishing the CI/CD pipeline, and the Orchestrator, and any
remaining tasks. The tasks for this sprint are as follows:


- finishing the CI/CD pipeline
- finishing Kubernetes
- testing and deploying the project
- finishing the documentation


The tasks were divided as follows:


- Ali Salesi: debugged broker due to issues with Kubernetes
- Amirhossein Barati: documenting and logging
- Arad Maleki: finishing the CI/CD pipeline and help in documenting
- Soroush Sherafat: finishing Kubernetes and testing and deploying the project


#### 5. Summary


This document contains the planning for the project. It contains the roles of each team member
in each phase, the tasks for each sprint, and the timeline for the project.
