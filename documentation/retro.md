### Retro Documentation


#### 1. Introduction


This is the retro documentation for the MiniKafka Project for the course "Systems 
Analysis & Design" at Sharif University of Technology, Fall 1402. This document will
contain the information about the retro meetings held, the feedback from the team members,
and the changes that will be made in the next sprint.


#### 2. Team Members


- Ali Salesi
- Soroush Sherafat
- Amirhossein Barati
- Arad Maleki


#### 3. Sprint 1


During this sprint, we set up the project, and created the basic structure of the project.
At the end of the sprint, we held a retro meeting to discuss the progress of the project,
and the tasks for the next sprint. The feedback from the team members was as follows:


- Communication was not as good as it should have been. We need to improve the communication
    between the team members.
- The tasks were not distributed evenly. Some team members had more work than others.
- We should consider k8s for the deployment of the project.


#### 4. Sprint 2


During this sprint, we implemented the basic functionality of the project. At the end of the
sprint, we held a retro meeting to discuss the progress of the project, and the tasks for the
next sprint. The feedback from the team members was as follows:


- Communication was better than the previous sprint, but still needs improvement.
- The tasks were distributed more evenly than the previous sprint, but still need improvement.
- k8s is too complex for the deployment of the project. We should consider using docker-compose
    instead.


#### 5. Sprint 3


During this sprint, we implemented the advanced functionality of the project. At the end of the
sprint, we held a retro meeting to discuss the progress of the project, and the tasks for the
next sprint. The feedback from the team members was as follows:


- We decided to use k8s for the deployment of the project, as it is more scalable than docker-compose.
- We decided to move our server to a faster server
- We discussed bugs and issues that we faced during the sprint, and how we can fix them in the next sprint.


#### 6. Sprint 4


This is the final sprint of the project. During this sprint, we focused on deploying the project,
CI/CD, and fixing the bugs and issues that we faced during the previous sprints. At the end of the
sprint, we held a retro meeting to discuss the progress of the project and finalize the project. The
feedback from the team members was as follows:


- We should have spent more time on k8s, as it was more complex than we thought.
- We should have used a faster server from the beginning, as it would have saved us time.


#### 7. Conclusion


This concludes the retro documentation for the MiniKafka Project. The feedback from the team members
was taken into consideration, and the necessary changes were made in the next sprint. The project was
finalized successfully, and the team members are satisfied with the outcome of the project.
